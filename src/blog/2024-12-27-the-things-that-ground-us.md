We get older and technology gets smarter, more integrated into everyday life. And yet, I find myself reaching for the things of the so-called past. Things often considered outdated, antiquated, and a waste of time.

Handwriting or cursive? Why teach what nobody uses anymore? Who writes handwritten letters? Why shoot film or own a camera when your phone has one already? Why wear a watch when your phone tells the time? Why listen to vinyl records when Spotify and YouTube exist?

Companies combine technology and the internet into many things. Because of this, it can often feel like we lose connections to things in the physical world. Things we hold. Things we help create. Things with a craftsmanship that gives us wonder. Things that help us feel more connected by allowing us to disconnect. Things that keep us in the present or bring back precious memories of the past.

Many of these technological improvements seem focused on our need for immediacy. Getting us what we want as fast as possible. In doing so, they focus on the outcome, the destination, and not the journey. It's in the journey where life happens. Where failure happens. Where joy and hurt, love and loss happen. It builds us up and shapes us. The things we take with us are an integral part of that journey, and how we use them matters.

We're not Luddites. We don't reject technology. Instead, we seek to be more intentional about its role in our lives. We don't want to lose sight of the things and people in front of us that keep us grounded.
