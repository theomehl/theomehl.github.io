There's a part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy where Pippin discovers a palantír at the ruins of Isengard and can't help but sneak a peek at it later that night after Gandalf confiscates it. As you might remember, his actions have severe consequences.

As I was watching that scene not that long ago, it struck me as very true of real life as well. We all have our own kinds of palantíri in our life that we seem unable to resist. Things that may gnaw at us and get the better of our curiosity until we act on those feelings, usually leading us places we wish we hadn't gone.

We're all a little bit Pippin, in our own way.
