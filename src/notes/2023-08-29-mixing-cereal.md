As a lover of cereal, I have many times found myself in a position where the rest of a box of cereal isn't enough for one bowl. So I add a little bit of the new box to the bowl, regardless of whether it's the same kind. Sacrilegious, you might say. But it can lead to unique taste combinations you wouldn't have thought were good.  

A little Krave with your Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Some Apple Jacks with your Lucky Charms (or Marshmallow Mateys if you prefer that superior Malt-O-Meal experience).  

Next time you find yourself between cereals, try mixing things up. You might get a dud flavor combo, or find something that becomes your new favorite thing.
